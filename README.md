Data Structures implementations in C

These are the implementations of Data structures and program design algorithms for arrays, queues, stack, linked list, graphs, trees. The implementation includes menu driven approach to provide functionalities to the user.

dspd prac 1 --> arrays basic iplementation and utilities.

dspd prac 2 --> sorting algorithms.

dspd prac 3 --> time complexity analysis of sorts in dspd prac2->sorts and some additional sorting algorithms.

dspd prac 4 --> implementation of stack, queue, circular queue.

dspd prac 5 --> infix to postfix implementation.

dspd prac 6 --> implementation of linked lists.

dspd prac 8 --> implementation of trees.

dspd prac 9 --> implementation of BST.

dspd prac 10 --> implementation of graphs, DFS, BFS, adjacency matrix.

dspd prac 11 --> implementation of djikstra's algorithms and warshall's algorithms.
